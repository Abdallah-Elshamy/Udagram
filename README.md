# Udagram Cloud Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](./frontend/README.md)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend.
2. [The RestAPI Backend](./main-server/README.md), a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service.
3. [The Image Filtering Microservice](./image-filter-service/README.md), It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.
